# Project Structure Refinement: Removal of Redundant Root-Level Flutter Project

## 1. Identified Problem

The initial project structure contained what appeared to be two Flutter applications:
- One at the root level (with `lib/`, `pubspec.yaml`, etc.)
- One within the `mobile/` directory.

Analysis confirmed that the root-level Flutter project was a basic template (default counter app) and was not the actual "FatGram" application. The fully developed "FatGram" application resides entirely within the `mobile/` directory.

This redundant structure presented several issues:
- **Confusion:** It could mislead developers about the true location of the active application code.
- **Maintenance Overhead:** Unnecessary files require tracking and could potentially interfere with global project scripts or IDE settings.
- **Build Complications:** CI/CD or local build scripts might mistakenly target the root project.

## 2. Resolution Steps

To address this, the following actions were taken:

### 2.1. Removal of Unnecessary Files and Directories

The following items, associated with the redundant root-level Flutter project, were deleted:
- `lib/` (directory)
- `test/` (directory)
- `pubspec.yaml` (file)
- `pubspec.lock` (file)
- `analysis_options.yaml` (file)

This cleanup ensures that the `mobile/` directory is the single source for the Flutter application code.

### 2.2. Update `README.md`

The main `README.md` file was updated to:
- Ensure clarity in the "インストール手順" (Installation Steps) section.
- Commands for Flutter setup (`flutter pub get`) and Firebase functions setup (`npm install`) were revised to use correct relative paths and ensure users return to the project root directory before executing subsequent scripts (like `./scripts/dev.sh`).
- The "プロジェクト構造" (Project Structure) section already correctly identified `mobile/` as the Flutter application directory and did not require changes.

### 2.3. Update CI/CD Workflows

The GitHub Actions workflow file at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` was modified:
- All Flutter-specific commands (`flutter pub get`, `flutter analyze`, `flutter test`) were updated to execute within the `mobile/` directory by adding the `working-directory: ./mobile` attribute to the respective steps. This ensures the CI pipeline targets the correct application.

## 3. Outcome

These changes streamline the project structure, reduce ambiguity, and ensure that development and CI/CD processes are focused on the correct application code within the `mobile/` directory. The repository is now cleaner and easier to navigate.
